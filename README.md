# This is a simple portfolio page that doubles as a page for my career consulting business. 

+I have included my resume along with a list of services for businesses and individuals. Originally completed for my front-end Code Louisville project requirement. 

+I incorporated bootstrap in my HTML to help with the initial set up of my nav bar. 

+To include JavaScript, I created an alert that is triggered by pressing the enter key in the mailing list field. Eventually, this will need to be updated to a more functional and practical integration.
